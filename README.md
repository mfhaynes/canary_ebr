# canary_ebr
These are the files which I use for presentations on Canary Testing with Edition-Based Redefinition.

This repository will be a living codebase, updated over time as the presentation evolves. To allow people to see the state of the scripts as of the time of a presentation, Releases will be tagged at the time of each presentation.

Presentation Releases:
